# cpePy
Camera Pose Estimator (Python) - Coding Challenge

Project was written in Python 2.7.6 using Cloud9 IDE, so there are some workarounds built into the code.
Included modules are:
  * OpenCV v2.4.11
  * Numpy
  * MatPlotLib
  
All code is included in **SRC** folder.
All images (including output file) are included in **STATIC** folder.
The input file (_pattern.jpg_) is located in **INPUT**, and is referred to as _src_ in the code.
The output file (_display.svg_) is located in **OUTPUT**.
Test images (in the form _IMG 6719.JPG_) are located in **IMG**. They are referred to as _img_ in the code.

Lines _2_, _3_, and _66_ in _main.py_ are included for pyplot to play nicely with Cloud9. If using a local environment which allows for real-time 3d viewing, these lines may be removed or commented, and line _63_ may be uncommented.
